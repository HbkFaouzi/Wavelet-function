# Wavelet-function
Wavelet transform is an efficient signal decomposition method, which can be used to denoise time series data. Wavelet transform is a well-documented effective “scalable” technique for time series data analysis with a higher time-frequency localization. Conventionally, discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) are generally used to increase the calculation efﬁciency of the prediction model.  Discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) are mostly used to process time-series data such as PV generated power, power consumption, stock, etc

# Wavelet mother function
Different wavelet mother function are availaible such as:
- Harr
- Daubechies
- Symlets
- Coiﬂets
- Biorthogonal
- Morlet
- Mexican Hat 

The most popular wavelet mother functions, including Haar, Daubechies (db3), Coiﬂets (coif2), and Symlets (sym4), are illustrated as following:
